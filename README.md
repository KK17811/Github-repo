How Data Was Scraped
To collect data, we used the GitHub API to fetch users located in Stockholm with more than 100 followers. For each user, we retrieved relevant details and their public repositories. The data was cleaned to meet specified formats, including trimming whitespace, formatting company names, and handling null values appropriately.

Interesting Findings
One of the most surprising findings was that a significant number of users from Stockholm specialize in programming languages like Python and JavaScript, reflecting current industry trends. Additionally, we found a strong correlation between the number of followers and the number of public repositories, suggesting that more active users tend to gain more visibility.

Recommendations for Developers
Developers are encouraged to engage with the community by contributing to open-source projects, as this not only increases their visibility but also enhances their learning experience. Additionally, having a well-maintained profile with clear bio descriptions and active repositories can attract more followers and potential job opportunities.
